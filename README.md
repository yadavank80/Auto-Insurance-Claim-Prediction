# Auto Insurance Claim Prediction
Given the data about previous insurance claims, our target is to predict the claim amount using machine learning techniques.  

I've tried to make the Jupyter Notebooks as discriptive as possible. 

## Dataset-
- The data set consists of observations about the claim of insurance policies by the policy holders.  
- It has **9134 such observations**.  
- Along with the claim amount, dataset has about **25 features**.  
**Target Variable:** 'Claim Amount'  

**The dataset has following columns and types:**  
- Customer                          object  
- Country                           object  
- State Code                        object  
- State                             object  
- Claim Amount                     float64  
- Response                          object  
- Coverage                          object  
- Education                         object

- Monthly Premium Auto               int64  
- Months Since Last Claim            int64  
- Months Since Policy Inception      int64  
- Number of Open Complaints          int64  
- Number of Policies                 int64  
- Policy Type                       object  
- Policy                            object
